Hi, this is Gee Hyun Kwon, looking at your Assignment A4.

At the end of this document is the output of our testing program and a table indicating
the points for each part.

Hi! Overall your code looks fine, but I need to do one more deduction:

Your triangle starts in the wrong orientation (-2).

Other than that, most of it looks fine. Most of your problems are in enforcing preconditions and postconditions. Make sure to check for them again and again to see that they are restoring everything before returning!

===========

Start of testing of A4

Max points for draw_triangle: 10
  Deduction 1 point. Turtle final color is 'blue' but should be 'red'.
End test of draw_triangle

Max points for draw_hex: 10
End test of draw_hex

Max points for draw_spiral, draw_spiral_helper: 17
Testing main draw_spiral function
End test of main draw_spiral function
Testing draw_spiral_helper function
  Deduction 1 point. Turtle final speed is 0 but should be 1.
  Deduction 1 point. Turtle color is 'red' but should be (red=3,green=4,blue=5,alpha=255).
End test of draw_spiral_helper function

Max points for multi_polygons, multi_polygons_helper: 17
Testing main multi_polygons function
End test of main multi_polygons function
Testing multi_polygons_helper function
End test of multi_polygons_helper function

Max points for radiate, radiate_helper: 17
Testing main radiate function
End test of main radiate function
Testing radiate_helper function
  Deduction 1 point. Turtle drawing speed is 9 but should be 0.
  Deduction 1 point. Turtle color is (hue=224.0,saturation=1.0,value=1.0) but should be (red=255,green=0,blue=255,alpha=255).
End test of multi_polygons_helper function

Max points for cantor, cantor_helper: 18
Testing main radiate function
End test of main cantor function
Testing cantor_helper function
  Deduction 2 points. The function does not enforce the precondition for x/y.
End test of cantor_helper function

Max points for sierpinski, sierpinski_helper: 18
Testing main sierpinski function
End test of main sierpinski function
Testing sierpinski_helper function
  Deduction 2 points. The function does not enforce the precondition for x/y.
End test of sierpinski_helper function

Max points for branches, branches_helper: 18
Testing main branches function
End test of main branches function
Testing branches_helper function
End test of tsquare_helper function
