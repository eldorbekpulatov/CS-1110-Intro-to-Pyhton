Hi, this is Jessica (jal476), looking at your Assignment A1.

Please revise your A1 solution as we suggest below. Look at each point 
and revise according to it before going on to the next. When done, resubmit. 
THEN SUBMIT A REQUEST FOR A REGRADE, SAYING SIMPLY THAT YOU RESUBMITTED. 
This is how we will know to regrade it. If we don’t get this regrade request, 
there will be no easy way for us to know that you resubmitted. Be sure you 
have set your notifications on the CMS so that you receive an email when a 
grade has been changed.

Testing Part A (Space breaking functions)
before_space(' 1 USD') is '1' but should be ''. 
after_space(' 1 USD') is 'USD' but should be '1 USD'. 


error
============
You have failed Testing Part A. Your methods have returned an output dissimilar to our own, and we are unable to 
proceed with all other tests after this. 

Please examine your code carefully. Be careful of the method "strip(String s)." By using "strip", are you accurately
able to fulfill the specifications of this program?  



You will not receive a 10 until all tests are passed. 
If you have made errors, please read the above carefully, revise carefully, resubmit, and then request a regrade.
